This app is based on the idea of deliberate practice and strives to make the process easier. First, you simply add goals and break them down to specific skills. Second, you allocate X amount of hours of work for a given goal, then for each skill of the associated goal you allocate a percentage slice of total goal time. Third, you whenever you are working on any given skill/goal you have a timer tracker to track and log your work. Finally, you'll see how well you are doing weekly, monthly, and yearly on the stats scene.
