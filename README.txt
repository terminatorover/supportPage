The idea is that, first, you set a goal give it X amount of hours, then break it down to skills and give Y% of the total goal time to each skill.
Second, you use the tracker(#timer built into the app )when you work on a given skill, which is always linked to a goal. 
Third, see how much you have done in a nice graph over the course of the week/month/year. I hope to get your feedback if you find bugs or any features that you would like to see.
